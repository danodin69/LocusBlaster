Dev Note -
 Although this may be a clone of [Harambert's spaceshooter](https://github.com/harambert/Godot-3D-Space-Shooter)],  the same license does not apply to this project, parts of Harambert's code were used only for what you see in that repo and therefore the license applies to parts of Locus Blaster built with it as well, beyond that it is not the same license, so do make sure to check on those things as to not run into future problems. This repo itself can be used for educational purposes and that is it, You may use nothing here commercially,  however [Locus Blaster beta 1.2(https://github.com/danodin69/LocusBlaster/releases/tag/v1.2-beta)] works on a less restrictive license for the <b>code</b> used in it.
