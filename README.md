<b>Description</b> 📝


A fun 3D space shooter with simple controls and awesome music, to while away time and keep the brain engaged. 


<b>Motive</b> 🏋️

I wanted to create a game I'd like to play when I'm pooping 💩  Also I was a fan of arcade games while growing up and just wanted to pay a tribute to my childhood by making my first public game in this genre. 

I know you will find it hyper and fun!
